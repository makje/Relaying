libusrp/matlab integrating code for cooperative relaying

This code gathers data from USRP1 device. For decoding a series of Matlab scripts are used, which loads the received data from files stored by a program that utilises "libusrp" to communicate with the USRP device. The master node of the network synchronizes the networks nodes transmission and reception of data via defined ethernet packages.

implementation.tar.gz
The code herein was developed in association with the thesis "USRP implementation strategies on USRP platform". It contains three different implementations of a QPSK BRRT. The first implementation utilizes the GNU Radio c++ programming framework, the second utilises "libusrp" to receive signals that are sub-sequentially decoded using IT++ while the third implementation also use "libusrp" to gather data and Matlab to decode the received data.
